GTIN
====

A collection of Global Trade Item Number (GTIN a.k.a. EAN's or barcode numbers) validators in various languages - it's turned into a way for me to have a play around with new languages, learning to deal with strings, conversions etc. Strings because leading zeros matter, by the way...

Validates as per http://www.gs1.org/how-calculate-check-digit-manually
